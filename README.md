## Game Theoretic Simulation of Cyber Network Attack and Defense Strategies 

This project uses game theoretic simulations and Monte Carlo methods to model how different attack and defense budgets and strategies, informed by node centrality, impact cyber network infiltration and node compromise. By evaluating the effectiveness of various risk management strategies, these simulations can be used to optimize network security.
